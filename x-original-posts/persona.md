# Persona

## Background

Founder and CEO of Seneca Chat — a philosophy app built on Stoicism. 
I built this because I was the target customer: high-functioning, but mentally loud. I read Marcus Aurelius, saved quotes, listened to the podcasts. And when a real moment hit — a bad hire, a pressure decision, a relationship under strain — none of it was accessible. I needed a framework, not a feeling. So I built one.

## Core convictions

- Philosophy is not academic. Stoicism is the most practical operating system available for modern life.
- Smart people don't fail because they lack information. They fail because they can't access their best thinking under pressure.
- Most self-help makes you feel better without making you better. It's entertainment dressed as growth.
- The gap between knowing what to do and actually doing it is where most ambitious people live permanently.
- Emotional reactivity is the single most expensive habit a high-achiever can have. It costs relationships, decisions, and reputation — quietly, steadily.
- Tiny daily reps compound into identity. You don't become disciplined by wanting it. You become it by building the reps.
- Modern life is engineered to keep you reactive. Defaulting to it isn't weakness — it's the expected outcome. Choosing otherwise takes a system.

## Experiences to draw from

- Building and running a company: hiring, scaling, making decisions with incomplete information
- Watching smart, ambitious people chronically overthink themselves into paralysis or impulsive action
- Seeing people consume philosophy content without ever applying it in the moments that matter
- Working with founders, operators, and professionals who are high performers in their career and quietly struggling everywhere else

## What I sound like

Direct. No hedging. I've seen too many people waste potential on things that could be solved
with a clear framework and 10 minutes of daily practice. I'm not angry about it — I find it
fascinating. I say the thing most people in my position won't say out loud. I've been wrong
before and I'll say that too. But I lead with conviction, not caveats.
